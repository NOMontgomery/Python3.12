# FN1. Assign a variable an integer value.
# FN2. Create an if statement, which determines whether the variable has
#      positive value and, if so, displays the value of the variable
#      followed by “ is positive” (like this: “5 is positive”).
# FN3. Add the last line of the program, which displays “Done!”. It should
#      always be displayed irrelevant of the value of the variable.
# FN3.1  Save, create new Debug Configuration, Put Breakpoint on the line
#        defining the variable, Run (Shift-F9), trace this program
#        step by step (F8).
# FN4. Change the code, so that it will display
#    - the variable’s value is followed by “ is negative” if the variable’s
#      value is negative, e.g., “-3 is negative”
#    - “0 is zero” if the variable’s value is zero
#    - the variable’s value followed by “ is positive” if the variable’s
#      value is positive, e.g., “5 is positive”
# FN4.1. Save, Run (Shift-F9), trace this program step by step (F8).
# FN5. Create a list containing 10+ integer numbers – both negative and positive.
# FN6. Change the code, so that all values in the list are checked and
#      messages are displayed, as described above.
# FN6.1. Save, Put Breakpoint on the line defining the list, Run (Shift-F9),
#        trace this program step by step (F8).
# def sum (x,y):
#     print("sum", x, "+", y, "=", x + y)
#
# def diff(x,y):
#     print("diff :", x, "-", y, "=", x - y)
